  <h1>Understanding XML and JavaScript</h1>

  <h2>What is XML?</h2>
  <p>XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. It's a markup language designed to store and transport data, resembling HTML but focused on carrying information rather than displaying it. XML uses tags to define data elements.</p>
  
  <h2>How is XML used?</h2>
  <p>XML is used for structuring, storing, and transmitting data across different systems and platforms. You can use XML to transfer data between two systems that store the same data in different formats. </p>

  <h2>What does XML look like? (Example)</h2>
  <p>For example, a website stores dates in MM/DD/YYYY format, but the accounting system stores dates in DD/MM/YYYY format. You can transfer the data from the website to the accounting system by using XML.


  <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
  <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that allows developers to add interactivity, dynamic content, and behavior to web pages. It's widely used for client-side scripting in web development. It is interpreted by the client.</p>
  
  <h2>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS?</h2>
  <p>HTML provides the structure, CSS styles the presentation, and JavaScript adds behavior and interactivity to web pages. JavaScript can manipulate HTML and CSS, enabling dynamic changes based on user actions.
